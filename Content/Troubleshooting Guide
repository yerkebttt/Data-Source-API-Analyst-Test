Troubleshooting Guide
Identify Common Issues
1. Authentication Errors

Example: "401 Unauthorized"
Check Authentication:
Verify the GITHUB_TOKEN or access token.
Ensure the token is active and has the necessary permissions for the requested action (e.g., repo, read:org, read:user).
Environment Variables:
Confirm that environment variables storing the token in Postman or scripts (e.g., Colab, Python) are correctly set and accessible.
Token Expiry:
If the token is expired, regenerate it and update the configuration.
2. Rate Limiting Issues

Example: "403 Forbidden" due to Rate Limit
Check Rate Limits:
Inspect the X-RateLimit-Remaining header in the response to confirm whether the limit has been reached.
Wait and Retry:
Use the X-RateLimit-Reset header to calculate the time until the rate limit resets.
Implement retry logic with a backoff mechanism (e.g., wait before retrying requests).
Use Authenticated Requests:
Authenticated requests typically have higher rate limits. Ensure all requests include a valid Authorization header.
3. Resource Not Found

Example: "404 Not Found"
Validate Endpoint and Resource:
Confirm that the API endpoint URL is correct.
Verify that the requested resource (e.g., repository name, owner, or file path) exists and is accessible.
Case Sensitivity:
Ensure correct case usage in repository names and paths, as GitHub is case-sensitive.
4. Request Format Errors

Example: "422 Unprocessable Entity"
Verify Request Parameters:
Ensure all required parameters are included and properly formatted.
Check for invalid or missing query strings or request body data.
API Documentation:
Refer to GitHub API documentation for valid parameter formats and examples.
5. Server-Side Errors

Example: "500 Internal Server Error" or "502 Bad Gateway"
Retry Logic:
Implement retries with a reasonable interval in case of temporary server-side issues.
GitHub Status:
Check GitHub’s status page (https://www.githubstatus.com/) for any reported outages or issues.
Handling Common Issues in Tools
1. Postman

Set Environment Variables:
Use Postman’s environment feature to securely store and use tokens or dynamic values.
Monitor Rate Limits:
Add test scripts in Postman to log headers like X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset.
2. Colab

Authentication Setup:
Use os.environ or store tokens securely in a notebook cell for temporary use.
Error Handling:
Implement Python exception handling with try-except blocks to capture API errors.
Use response.status_code to manage different error scenarios.
By systematically addressing these common issues, the troubleshooting process becomes structured, ensuring smoother and more reliable API interactions.
